## Technicalities {#technicalities}

Despite the general aversion to systematization without reason, there are some processes that we've found help set up X-Team developers for success. The following are the few things that we think you'll find helpful in being a successful remote developer.

### The Core Team {#coreteam}

![](../../.gitbook/assets/coreteam.jpg)

You'll see us reference "the Core Team" several times throughout this guide. This is referring to the team that keeps X-Team running. That's some of us above, hanging out in Thailand, envisioning the future of X-Team.

We named this team after open source projects, which also have core teams. Why? Because we see ourselves as a team of people dedicated to supporting X-Team developers, helping to reach new highs and to keep moving forward.

We're the ones who help create opportunities throughout the community for you to learn, grow, explore the world, stay healthy, and unleash your potential.

**We're here to support you, 24/7.**

Unsure of who to talk to on the core team for help? Start with [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6); he will either help you himself or direct you to the right person.

At the time of this writing, the Core Team includes:
- Ryan Chartrand, CEO
- Jake Foley, CGO, Account Manager
- Brad Giblin, COO, Account Manager
- Josh Johnston, CTO
- Mike Rhoads, Head of Apps
- Sam Accetta, Head of Finance
- Luke Foley, Head of Partnerships, Account Manager
- Alberto Grande, Head of Marketing
- Caleb Brown, Ambassador
- Paul McCrodden, Internal Product Owner
- Gosia Jezierska, Internal Project Manager
- David Roberts, Cavalry Manager
- Grant Bartel, Recruiter
- Jomar Garcia, Recruiter
- Elaine Lithgow, Game Designer
- Thomas De Moor, Content Creator
- Ben Ferreira, Community Organizer

### Journaling {#journaling}

Let's jump into what we find is the most valuable piece of advice for ANY remote worker.

The word "journal" probably brings to mind things like: “Dear Diary...” But what we're talking about is much closer to \`Captain's log, stardate 2017-09-10\`.

Many X-Teamers maintain daily journals as a way to build trust with the teams they work on.

Here's a taste of what they look like:

Slack Tips Tuesday: How to Not Look Like a Slacker on Slack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnzE9ip5U04)

It's not really about looking like a slacker, it's more about how valuable we've found active communication to be.

See, there are two distinct objectives when writing these X-Journals.

* The **first one is for the team you work with** to be able to see at any time, what you’re working on, how you’re progressing, etc. There might be daily or weekly standups, but nothing communicates competence like a journal of achievements you can always point to or which they can always check, when in doubt. This journal would be a channel in the project's slack.

  This is the journal you may or may not already be writing. It is pretty much a summary of your daily work, and it should be primarily accessible by the **team that works with you on the project**, which will usually be on your project's slack. It should include things like what tickets you worked on, what problems you ran into and how you solved them, what you learned that day...

* The **second one is for us, the core team,** here at X-Team in X-Teams slack. This journal is a copy of the first one **with additional reflections** on any and all characteristics of the project you’re working on — to reflect on project health, so to speak. Many people simply setup Zapier or a similar tool to duplicate the first journal from the project's slack to X-Team's slack, so they only have to add the reflections, if there are any.

  Are there a ton of issues that aren’t being tackled and your suggestions are being ignored? Put it here.

  Is the client’s communication erratic or hard to follow? Are the goalposts being moved all the time? Put it here.

  Does the client not provide you with what you need to be able to do your job? For Flying Spaghetti Monster’s sake, PUT IT HERE!

  **Basically, this second journal is here so we know what is going on and can step in and help solve problems before they evolve to their final form.**

And if you are worried about how “complaining” is going to come across — no one in X-Team has ever landed in hot water for expressing objective criticism. Obviously, it has to be professionally done — like putting it in this journal and/or messaging [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6) and/or your account manager directly, but you will definitely not be penalized for it. If anything, “comparing notes” from several X-Teamers on a project could be helpful in potentially improving the work environment for everyone.

As a final note, if you're working on an internal project, you only need one journal. Don't duplicate it, in that case.

#### Step I/III {#journaling-i}

So, now that you’ve read all this, if you’re not keeping an X-Team journal yet, why not give it a shot? It's entirely optional, of course, but if you're interested in the idea, here are some basic steps to start:

1. Create a channel \(public or private, your choice\) in X-Team's Slack with the name structure \#journal-john
2. Invite whoever you had your onboarding call with into the channel.
3. Invite your account manager \(the person responsible for your team — if unsure who that is, ask @luke\)
4. Create the first, Hello World! post, which should include a simple introduction of yourself, with things like:
5. What are your usual working hours \(and timezone\)?
6. What is your preferred work environment? Beaches, mountain cabins, cafes, your own comfy bed...
7. What does a normal day for you involve \(no need to share anything personal you feel uncomfortable sharing\)

_PROTIP : If you need an example journal, take a look at [#journal-samuel-pepys](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C71UM6BAN) on our Slack._

Once you get the hang of the idea and are posting consistently to it, create a journal in the client's Slack as well. **Just make sure not to post your concerns about the client in that journal, but rather in your X-Team journal channel so we can help you.**

#### Step II/III {#journaling-ii}

There are a few journaling techniques we've found which are great at building trust with your team.

The first one is called **TIL \(Today I Learned\).** 

Through the years, we’ve established that there’s nothing that builds trust with partners like some good ol' transparency and sharing of knowledge. That’s why we want you to implement this technique in your daily routine.

**TIL**

**What is a TIL?**

TIL \(Today I Learned\) posts can be really short. They show one thing you learned while working on the project.

Sometimes, it's something very specific to the project, like a significant requirement that you found while digging through some docs. Another time, it's more general info that you discovered or remembered along the way, like a debugging technique or a handy bash trick.

**How to write a TIL**

Start looking for those little "learning moments" in your day and quickly jot down some notes in your journal. Remember, keep it quick & raw. If others read it and have questions, they can ask for more info.

Try to keep it down to a couple of sentences and maybe a code snippet or screenshot.

**Exercise:** Try making a couple of TIL posts during your working day.

**Why do we often avoid this?**

It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking"I won't share that TIL, because everybody probably knows it already, and I will seem dumb!”Or“What if I'm wrong and there's actually a better way to do it??"

As a wise commander once pointed out, _"It's a trap!"_

Just do it, and everyone will thank you later.

**Why should we do this?**

Let's address those two fears:

_"Everybody probably knows it already."_

Who cares :\) Maybe they do, but maybe they don't. Only someone very arrogant will think badly of you at this point. That's their problem, not yours.

_"What if I'm wrong and there's actually a better way to do it?"_

Again, don't let this stop you. If somebody else knows a better way, this may be your golden opportunity to learn it! They might have been avoiding sharing this knowledge for the very same reason described above! This is your chance to break the cycle.

**Example:**

The other day I was reviewing pull requests on a GitHub project, I and remembered a handy way to review them locally. I wrote it as a quick "TIL" entry, and since there's no sensitive business info there I also posted it to Twitter: [https://twitter.com/joshwnj/status/855215578042073088](https://twitter.com/joshwnj/status/855215578042073088)

In a couple of days, it had 13 retweets and 9 likes. That's nothing groundbreaking, but if there's a handful of people that found it useful, it's totally worth the 2 minutes it took him to do it.

#### Step III/III {#journaling-iii}

It’s time to share with you another great journaling technique about reflections. Once you gather some entries in your journal, they are a great resource to reflect upon and make improvements.

**Reflections**

Having done hundreds of code reviews, we've found reflections to be a very helpful process to learn about good programming techniques. Sometimes, we review some code, and instinct tells us it is "good" or "bad".

The next step is to try and articulate why. Is it just written in a style that goes with or against our personal preference? Or is there some deeper reason?

We encourage you to use code reviews as an opportunity to write new journal entries. Writing "reflection" entries is similar to TIL, but rather than learning something new, the focus is on describing something you observed and why you liked/disliked it.

**Reflect on your own code**

It's helpful to write reflections on your own code as well.

**We don't always have time to complete everything to the level of perfection we hoped, so this is an opportunity to add more context to any rough edges you may have had to leave behind.**

* Think about future maintainers of the code, or other people doing similar activities in the future. Are there things they'll need to keep in mind or things that will make their job easier?
* If you were to implement this feature again in the future, are there things you would do differently?
* Any known tradeoffs or pros/cons of the approach you took, especially if it has an impact on other parts of the system.
* Finally, did you observe the golden rule of coding? I.e., _“Always write code assuming the next person that’ll work with it is a violent psychopath that knows where you live.”_

### Invoicing & Time Off {#invoicing}

**Twice a month** (1st - 3rd and 16th - 18th), you will have the opportunity to submit your invoice with the total number of hours worked, reimbursement requests, etc.

You should receive the "Invoice Time" email reminder from Mike Rhoads when the invoicing period opens. There should also be a "Submit Your Invoice" event on your X-Team gCal. If either one of these is missing, let [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6) know.

Once you receive the invoice period notification, go to [XHQ](https://xhq.x-team.com). There, if you click on your avatar, you will find your banking information and profile sections, which you should fill out the first time you’re there. In the left menu, you have several options, with the two important for now being **Vacation Request** and **Submit Invoice**.

> **IMPORTANT** — Fill out the banking info _**before**_ you start a new invoice.

**Vacation Request**  
You should always **request time off at least a month in advance**, preferably more. However, we understand that unexpected things happen, and if at all within our power, we'll have your back in emergencies. Either way, if you clear it with your teammates, project manager, and account manager (usually Brad, Jake, or Luke), it'll be fine.

**Submit Invoice**  
When you click it, you’ll go through a several steps.

1. **Invoice Setup** Select the date range for the invoice. It should be automatically preset for the correct range.
2. **Hours** Input how many hours you worked on which project in this invoicing period.
3. **Reimbursements** Enter any reimbursements you may wish to claim. Some examples would be [Unleash+ Budget reimbursements](https://xhq.x-team.com/unleash). If unsure, whether something fits, ping [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6).
4. **Add Referral Bonus** Have you shown someone the light of the X and they accepted it as their meaning in life? Once they have a contract with us, you can claim the Referral Bonus here.
5. **Banking info** Double-check where the money is going since the worst thing is to not get the money because of a stupid typo.  And that's it. If you’re experiencing any kind of problems with your payments, just talk to our Head of Apps, Mike Rhoads \(@mikerhoads\), and he’ll help you out.
6. **Notes** Right, if you'd like, you can also leave us a note here.

After these steps, there is a short how-are-we-feeling survey to be filled out, and then you're truly done. As a little guideline for the survey smileys, their meanings are as follows:

🙂 - "Life is wonderful! There may be some little issues here and there, but nothing I can't handle."  
😑 - "Hmm, got some stuff going on here I'd like to talk to [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6) about..."  
🙁- "Somebody help me!"

### Unleash+ {#unleash-budget}

![](../../.gitbook/assets/unleash.jpg)

You didn't think we'd forget about this, did you? [This jewel](https://xhq.x-team.com/unleash), **reserved for X-Teamers on an internal or partner project**, is the equivalent of USD 2,500 per calendar year, which is there to keep your skills current, your body fit, your mind sane, and your entertainment desires tickled. There are several categories of expenses you can use your Unleash Budget for with the general limit being a cap of $100/month/category unless [otherwise specified in XHQ](https://xhq.x-team.com/unleash). The Unleash+ budget unlocks after you've been with us for a month.

If you are unsure whether something you'd like to get fits into one of these categories or if it isn't included in the list at all, shoot a quick ping to [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6), and he'll help you figure it out. One thing that is a hard impossible is equipment that can be considered usual work equipment for an IT contractor because of legal reasons. Note that it doesn't matter what you'll be using it for but what the "friendly folks at the tax office" would think you'd use it for. Also impossible are e.g. medical cost reimbursements.

**The only rule is:** Everyone in our community benefits by others sharing \(including you\), so using your budget has to result in sharing something with the community. For example, if it’s a course/book, then publish a short review or a recommendation in the _**\#courses**_ channel; if it’s a conference you attended, you could write a blog post about your takeaways. You get the idea.

_In case you would like to see some real-life examples, head over to \#courses and see reviews that are already there. Check out_ [_this post_](https://x-team.slack.com/files/U1XDNKJ0J/F899X5KFW/Courses_Budget) _first to get all the details._
