## Community

We keep stressing that X-Team is a community of like-minded people who want to see the world proper and make it a better place. But it being a community — how does that actually show?

Well, there are several elements to it...

### Slack

You know Slack. Everyone knows Slack. We spend ungodly hours on it — because we want to and it's fun, not because we have to — and there's always something fun to do. If you're interested in just about anything, chances are, we have a channel for it with people who share that interest. You can look up the list of existing channels in slack or [here](slack_channels.md), if you're only interested in the most popular ones, but what do you do if your favorite pastime isn't on it?

Ping [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6) and tell him that the impossible happened. Explain what your hobby/interest is and that you'd love to share it with the community. He'll get you sorted with instructions on how to do it, get you feedback on potential previous experience with it from the Core Team, and once everything is ready, he'll help you get this new little piece of heaven announced to the community via our announcements channel.

You can also get an idea [in this guide](community-guardian-guide.md) of what it's like leading a Slack group by becoming a Community Guardian.

And if you are wondering if something you might be interested in is already going on in a form that is a bit more active than _just_ a channel, take a look at our glorious [Community Page](http://community.x-team.com/).

### Community Initiatives

We have a ton of community initiatives going on. Actually, by the end of 2017, we had so many, that we had to cut back. This is why we decided to reorganize and have kicked 2018 off with a new structure.

#### Quests — Study groups for interesting topics

Over the course of the year, there will be 3 **Unleash Quests** running more or less continuously. Each of these quests has its own Slack channel, where there are \(usually weekly\) challenges posted, which participants have to pass. At the end, participants who do well are rewarded with [X-Coins]().

As an example, the Unleash Quests running in January 2018 were:

* [UQ: Writing for Programmers 101](http://community.x-team.com/uq-writing/) — [\#unleash-quest-writing](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C8PSERD0A)
* [UQ: React & Redux](http://community.x-team.com/uq-react/) — [\#unleash-quest-react](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C8HV0T458)
* [UQ: Git](http://community.x-team.com/uq-git/) — [\#unleash-quest-git](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C8RASKU7J)

There are also other quests, like [Productivity Quest](http://community.x-team.com/productivity) \([\#productivity-quest](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C789928SY)\) or [Fit-Quest](https://x-team.com/blog/fit-quest-our-slack-survival-fitness-game/) \([\#fit-quest](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C5NGD3EA2/)\).

You can always find the current quests on our [Community Page](http://community.x-team.com/).

If you have an idea for an Unleash Quest you would like to see happen, let [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6) know, and he'll help you make it happen, if at all possible.

#### Clubs

Clubs are channels with specialized topics, where there is at least some degree of organized activity. Clubs occasionally run activities, where it is also possible to earn [X-Coins]().

Current examples thereof are:

* [Yoga Club](http://community.x-team.com/yoga) — [\#yoga](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C76CK2VU2)
* [Game Club](http://community.x-team.com/games) — [\#game-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C3WV9FYGJ)
* [Photography Club](http://community.x-team.com/photography) — [\#photography-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C79JCSBPH)
* [Cycling Club](http://community.x-team.com/cycling) — [\#cycling-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C740KNBPA)
* [Haskell Learning Club](http://community.x-team.com/clubs/#haskell-learning-club) —[\#haskell-learning-club](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C8T6XRZRV)

As with quests, if you would like to start another club, or if you just have an idea for one, talk to [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6).
