# X-Team's Core Values

X-Teamers are incredibly diverse in so many ways, from skillsets to beliefs and beyond, but our core values are a baseline of attributes that we all share. They are the most important characteristics we look for before welcoming anyone into our community, and they are critical to making X-Team successful for many years to come. Thus, we decided to write down these characteristics and personal values, so there's never any doubt what we're all about.

## Active Communication {#active-communication}

### Quiet as a Church Mouse

Do you know the feeling of working in a “traditional” company, where expressing personal convictions or asking too many questions is met with a negative response?

Yes, we hate that too, so we made Active Communication one of our core values.

This means that, not only will we not sanction you for speaking your mind \(keep it professional, of course\), but we actively encourage it. We want to know what is going on with you, both professionally and, provided you are willing to share, personally. We are nurturing a community that truly is a group of friends working together, traveling together, gaming together, talking together… You may not be into everything we do, but chances are there are a few X-Teamers who share your passions and would love to have you join their group.

### Feedback

Feedback is something that feeds into this Active Communication value as well. Our community places a huge value on both letting people know they're appreciated and on giving constructive criticism when necessary. Everyone loves giving and getting high-fives, but if there is something that can be improved, that should be communicated as well. You will _**never**_ get in trouble for giving constructive criticism. However, if you'd still prefer to remain anonymous, talk to [@ben](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/D23Q0MCQ6) and he'll pass your concerns on without mentioning who they're from.

### Building Trust

There is more to Active Communication than just building an awesome community, however. _**Keeping your comm lines open builds trust.**_

Since X-Team is 100% remote, we cannot — _and do not want to _— constantly watch what you are doing. We abhor the practice of requiring people to install privacy-intruding software that spies on what they are doing at all times. We do not count minutes you have spent working every day, nor should you.

Instead, _**we believe in trusting people. Period.**_

We hired you after all, why shouldn't we trust you?

There are four things that can help you maintain and strengthen that trust every day.

* **A journal of activity**  
  A Slack channel kept by every X-Teamer, where they record their daily progress.

* **Make yourself visible and available.**  
  Say "hello" to your team when you start working as it sets them at ease knowing you're connected and contributing. We don't expect you to work 9-5, but if you set expectations with your team to be available at a certain time, stay true to your word or reset expectations as soon as you can. Never leave your team hanging as they'd never do that to you.

* **Sincerity and openness towards the core-team**  
  Their job is to make things go smoothly, so if there is _**\*anything\***_ you feel they should know, tell them. Nobody has ever been in trouble for professionally bringing up issues so they could be solved, be it regarding the project, their X-Team experience, or something else entirely.

* **Being active on Slack**  
  Through the vetting process, the core-team has come to trust you. Through your participation in your team, they will hopefully grow to trust you as well. But at the end of the day, we're a rather large community, and it never hurts to have more friends you can count on, so be active on slack, respond, react, and have fun with everyone :\)

## Ownership {#ownership}

Being a true X-Teamer in terms of ownership means that you are:

* **Taking responsibility**  
  When you take something on, whether it be a new projects, ideas, solutions, etc., you should treat it like your own and take pride in it, seeing it through from conception to completion. It's your baby, so deliver it and care for it like you would a real child.

* **Committed**  
  Your motivation might change over the course of a project, but it doesn't mean you should start putting in less effort. When you committed to doing it, you made a pact with yourself that said "I will see this through, I will keep moving forward, I will unleash my potential, because I believe in making an impact in this team."

* **Uphold quality**  
  We've learned a lot from the world of open source. X-Teamers are developers who code like the world is watching, like you're submitting a PR to a project with 10,000 stars on Github even if it's just a team of three. This is your project and it deserves nothing less than 100% of what you can provide it. Don't get lazy, stay committed to yourself and what you believe in.

## Compassion {#compassion}

Helping others makes everyone feel good. It is one of the most basic human instincts, developed out of the raw need for survival. We were lucky enough to be born in places and situations that enabled us to become what we are today and to be able to give back to our communities and the world at large.

You were meant to make an impact in this world, and we want to help you do just that every day.

This is why we strongly believe in and act on the two types of Compassion.

### External Compassion

External Compassion targets other people’s external circumstances. X-Teamers and X-Team both try and help as many people as possible, directly, through organization and participation of various charitable events, like coding schools for the underprivileged, talks at schools, general charity work, and also monetary donations to charitable causes. Even improving one life is worth it, and every little bit of difference we make gives us more conviction that what we are doing is the right thing to do.

Every year, you can participate in the [12 Days of X-Mas](https://x-team.com/blog/x-teamers-donate-3-500-to-great-causes/) and help us donate to great causes you believe in.

### Internal Compassion

Internal compassion, empathy, this is the ability to put oneself into another’s shoes. X-Team is a group of people from all over the world with various religious, economic, political, social, and other beliefs — believe us, we know, we have \#economy-and-politics — but despite debates taking place among people who hold the exact opposite beliefs, we always keep in mind that this person is our friend and teammate. They may hold beliefs that differ from ours, but that does not make them a worse person. Their life experience has brought them to different conclusions, and we respect that and try to understand the issue from their point-of-view.

The way people communicate throughout the X-Team community will inspire you to truly embrace empathy on a daily basis.

### Open to learning {#open-to-learning}

We love seeing X-Teamers learn and share their knowledge. That's why we have dedicated a yearly Unleash Budget for you. You have $2,500 to spend every year for the purposes of self development. Whether you need an online course, a book, to experiment with a new tool that has some paid subscription - we’ve got you covered.

**The only rule is:** Everyone in our community benefits by others sharing \(including you\), so using your budget has to result in sharing something with the community. For example, if it’s a course/book, then publish a short review or a recommendation in the _**\#courses**_ channel; if it's a club/quest expense, post about it in the corresponding channel; if it’s a conference you attended, you could write a blog post about your takeaways. You get the idea.

_In case you would like to see some real life examples, head over to \#courses and see reviews that are already in there. Check out _[_this post_](https://x-team.slack.com/files/U1XDNKJ0J/F899X5KFW/Courses_Budget)_ first to get all the details._

A true X-Teamer is open to learning in the following sense:

* **Is willing to learn new technologies**  
  We really appreciate X-Teamers who aren’t narrow-minded about their craftsman toolbelt. Your project required you to learn Vue.js and you’re a hardcore PHP guy? Guess what, there’s nothing that says more about a developer than their versatility.

* **Learns from mistakes**  
  Learning doesn’t mean that you have to only look into the future. It’s very valuable to look behind and retrospect on your actions. This is where the journal you created during your onboarding comes in handy — use it to post retrospectives on projects or even just your week. Always be searching for lessons you can learn in the work you’re doing.

* **Is curious to learn**  
    This is where your creativity comes into play. During your time with X-Team, and may it be long, we would love for you to learn and grow as a professional. Use you Unleash budget wisely and share your knowledge with other X-Teamers. Gain experience by always trying something new.

An example of the **Openness to Learning** is the participation of 24 X-Teamers in the **UnleashConf**, where they all shared their knowledge and learned from the community — they also had a great time in general, as the even was dubbed "The Greatest Event in X-Team History" by some, so don't miss the next iteration ;\)

## Proactiveness {#proactiveness}

The British Dictionary defines _"proactive"_ as _“tending to initiate change rather than reacting to events”_. That is exactly how X-Teamers behave in their natural environment — remote work. We don’t wait for things to happen, we take control of our work, project and situation and _act_.

Being a true X-Teamer in terms of proactiveness means that you are:

* **Keeping Things Moving Forward**  
    You don’t wait for that next ticket to get assigned to you; when you see a potential for improvement in the project you’re working on or a new feature comes to your mind, you’re the first to reach out, propose it, fix it, and do it. You are in control.

* **Unblockable**  
    Remote work can be tough. All of us have had situations where we had to wait 12+ hours for someone to answer our question, clear out our doubts or just finish that task we’re dependent on.  
  The key here is to do as much as possible in any given situation. Don’t just ask a question and leave it - propose a solution in the meantime, code something alternative that could solve the issue, show that you are proactive beyond the obstacles of being remote.

* **Adaptable**  
    We all love technology but that doesn’t mean any of us have to be that “I only do PHP/JS/Java” developer. We appreciate being open and adaptable to solve any given task, no matter the technologies and obstacles that we’re given. Every opportunity we’re given is an opportunity to learn and unleash our potential in new ways.

* **Not Needing Your Hand Held**  
    There is a certain period in every project’s life when you’re the new recruit. Put yourself in the shoes of our partners — they need someone who can come in, take the initiative and hit the ground running in every project. They don’t need someone who needs to have their hand held through everything. It’s good to ask questions to remain ‘unblockable’, but always keep pushing forward as much as you can and never wait to be told what to do.

* **Iterative/Reflective**  
    Everyone makes mistakes. The best ones reflect on them and progress in the next iteration. Take the time to reflect, learn and stay humble — no one’s perfect, we are always evolving and becoming better than we were yesterday.

* **Constantly Improving**  
    Be hungry for more knowledge and expertise. Improve your skills and craft with courses, lectures, going to meetups and conferences. Keep the saw sharp. This industry is constantly changing, and only those who change alongside it will have the most rewarding careers.
