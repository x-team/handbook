# How to guardian an outpost

You'll be waking up at 4:30 every morning to prepare everyone's breakfast. Then you will work until you have to go wake up everyone at the time they specified. After...

Just kidding. Being a guardian isn't that much different from being an outposteer. You might be one of the few or maybe even the only person who speaks the local language, so you will be expected to help people sort out things and get settled in. You should provide some activity suggestions, and you definitely should be the one organizing the epic.

Having said that, your role is not that of a butler or a concierge. While you're there to make sure things run smoothly, that *does not* include doing everything for everyone. You don't have to go shopping for people, you don't have to do food deliveries for them, and in general, you shouldn't disregard yourself - you're supposed to have a good time as well.

Keep in mind that everyone is an adult (or accompanied by their parents in case of XO Families), so they should be able to take care of themselves. If they're newbies at traveling to very different places from the ones they're from, you might want to keep an eye on them, maybe give them some extra explanations, but that's it. Everything above and beyond that is up to your own good will.

An outpost is a collaborative experience, and while there's a leader - you - it comes down to everyone to make it a great experience.
