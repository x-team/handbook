# How does it work?

## Where can I see what outposts I can sign up for?

The first thing you have to do is go on over to the #x-announcements channel and check whether there were any outpost-related news in the past quarter. If there are, chances are you'll see something like **"X-OUTPOST MARS OPEN FOR SIGN-UPS"**. That is your cue to hit all the links provided under that notification, read up on the details, and if you like what you're seeing, join the outpost channel (#xo-mars for the above example), and click on the signup link. This will take you to the signup form, which you fill out and submit. Then you wait until a few days after the deadline, and in the outpost channel, there will come a notification on who has a confirmed spot and who is on the waitlist.

## Confirmed spots? Waitlist?

Normally, Outposts support 6 people with their better halves plus the guardian and their SO. If more people sign up, we see if it's comfortably feasible. If so, more people can go. If not, we sort everyone according to the number of outposts they've already attended and been confirmed for in ascending order and create a cut-off somewhere.

**N.B.: Do not make any travel accommodations until you've been definitively confirmed for the outpost!**

## OK, I'm confirmed, what now?

Now you have a lively discussion with everyone else in the channel. The guardian will keep you up to date with the details. One important thing to keep in mind is that your place is guaranteed with 500 USD of your Unleash+ budget until you present proof-of-travel, which can be a flight ticket, fresh visa for the destination country or anything else that definitively confirms you're going. If you have to withdraw after having been confirmed, however, the 500 USD won't be deducted from your U+ budget if there's someone else going in your stead (e.g. someone from the waitlist or a new applicant if there's no waitlist).

## Outpost canceled?

Sometimes - very, VERY rarely - an outpost will be canceled. This will most likely never happened once people have already made travel arrangements, but it might happen earlier in the process. Usually, it is because either the guardian has informed us that it won't be possible for them to guardian the outpost, and no replacement can be found, or because the number of participant didn't hit at least three plus guardian.

## Got it, ready to get ready!
