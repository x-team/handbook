# Organization

## Main goals

1. Create an opportunity to hang out with colleagues.
1. Exchange knowledge and share feedback on the company via group discussions.
1. Build relationships with local communities of developers interested in remote work, unleashing their potential, and X-Team.

## Main considerations

You need a plan that should include:

1. A location (or several) that:
   * Is easily accessible internationally  
     Exception: Themed outpost/camps, e.g. survival in a remote region, road trip etc.
   * Has everything necessary for people to be able to work.
   * Is not extremely expensive.
   * Can provide exciting activities to do together or even just cool places to hang out.
   * Has a decent community of developers. *(Optional but very welcome)*

2. Accommodation that:
   * Can host a fair number of X-Teamers, preferably one big house/villa. If that is not possible, several places in walking proximity.  
   Exception: Correspondingly themed outposts/camps.
   * When you pass us the accommodation reservation link, please make sure that
     * the page language for the share is set to English,
     * the currency is set to USD, and
     * the share includes all the relevant settings (date, number of people, etc.)

3. Activities for integration with X-Teamers (and potentially the local dev community):
   - This can be anything you find entertaining, but try to aim for something with a little adrenaline-rush, as well as having a team-building aspect. Think paintball/airsoft/laser-tag, go-karting, ATV rides, ziplining etc.
   - We may also want to invite some of the local developers, so make sure the type of the activity you choose allows for that.

## Summary

If you come up with a plan which lets X-Teamers experience something extraordinary, be it an unforgettable location, activity, adventure, or all of the above, chances are good that it would make for a great Outpost. Even if it sounds crazy (5k km road trip? Climbing Mt Kilimanjaro? Survivalism in the Swedish wilderness? Drifting and cardrenaline galore?), please, do bring it up. We’re always interested in providing unforgettable experiences for X-Teamers.
