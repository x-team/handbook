# Quality Communication Guidelines

As you know by now, X-Team is a community of people who work hard together and party hard together. We also communicate a lot, and while we are strong supporters of one's freedom to share their opinion, there are two limitations:

1. Be courteous. Demeaning language, sarcasm, rudeness or hostility towards a person, race, nation, religion are absolutely not welcome.

2. In case of disagreements, professional or otherwise, address the arguments, not the person. The subject of your sentence should be “the evidence” or “this source” or some other noun directly related to the topic of conversation.

As you can see, these are common sense rules, which we have fortunately never actually had to enforce.

As you may or may not have noticed, there is also a slack channel called [\#economy-and-politics](https://x-team.slack.com/messages/C03HGUATN). That channel is home to debates about those topics, and since X-Team is made up of people with a very wide spectrum of political opinions and beliefs, that channel has stronger moderation and two additional rules that keep hot tempers in check:

1. Source your facts. If you’re claiming something to be true, you need to back it up with a qualified source. There is no “common knowledge” exception, and anecdotal evidence is not allowed.

2. Be substantive. \#economy-and-politics is a serious discussion-based channel. We do not allow bare expressions of opinion, low-effort one-liner comments, jokes, memes, and off-topic replies.

If you're ever in doubt whether something is OK to post, be it in \#economy-and-politics or in general, @brad is the right person to ask.
