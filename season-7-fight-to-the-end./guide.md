## Introduction

Welcome to **Season 7:** _**FIGHT TO THE END.**_

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH3vRULomgQ" %}

> "_**There's a part of us that wants to know what else 2020 has to offer; to see what another dose of discomfort can awaken within us.**_"

Here we are, exhausted beyond our limits after 8 months of endless emotions, endlessly reinventing our lives, endlessly living in constant discomfort. When everything feels endless, **we are collectively losing motivation, ready to just coast to the holidays.**

But there's an alternative: to see what else 2020 has to offer. **To not crawl your way to the finish line, but to cross it proud.** To finish strong. To keep the momentum going and let the discomfort awaken something within you one last time this year. We may never be in such prime conditions for growth ever again.

There's only one way to take that alternate route, however: **we're going to need serious energy boosts to rebuild the momentum**. We must fight against burnout with every day that remains. We must make time for more breaks. We must find energizing moments ahead of us that will slingshot us forward. And once re-energized, we must embrace the discomfort one last time to see what it brings out of us.

This Season is the beginning of a new chapter in many ways. Everything new we've come up with was the result of us actively fighting off the burnout, getting re-energized, and then embracing all of the discomfort that innovation comes with. Take this Season's new direction as inspiration that there is still more you can awaken in yourself in these last 65 days.

{% hint style="info" %}
 **If this is your first time participating in a Season at X-Team**, Seasons are multi-month experiences crafted to help you learn, grow and explore. Each theme has its own theme and accompanying Events, Bounties, Collectibles, and more which you'll find out more about below.
{% endhint %}

## Bounties

Bounties are personal challenges that you can take part in every Season. They are like the achievements or trophies in your favorite video game, but in this case, the game is your life. 

As Season 7 serves as Early Access to our 2021 Community, we've made some groundbreaking new iterations, notably: **Legendary Bounties** and **Create a Bounty.**

### **Legendary Bounties**

These special seven are the flagship Bounties of the Season: they pay the highest reward \(4-5 coins\) and are the most epic to have on your board thanks to their beautiful designs that stand out.

We wanted to bring back the excitement of new Bounties by putting in the effort to make our featured Bounties look truly legendary. We hope you enjoy them, check them out on [**the Bounties page.**](https://xhq.x-team.com/bounties)\*\*\*\*

![](../.gitbook/assets/legendaries.gif)

**How Bounties Work:** Every time you complete a Bounty, you will gain coins. The harder the bounty, the more coins you earn. These can be used in [**The Vault**](https://xhq.x-team.com/vault) to purchase different kinds of Loot, from hats and notebooks to t-shirts and donations to charity, you should always have something to put your coins towards. New items are added to the Vault regularly, so be sure to check back often so you don't miss out on something awesome.

{% hint style="info" %}
Consider also using [**Unleash+**](http://xhq.x-team.com/unleash) ****this season to help you complete Bounties.
{% endhint %}

## Create a Bounty

In Season 7, we're releasing a game-changing feature into Early Access in November: **the ability to create your own Bounty.**

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2853%29.png)

We've purposely left the board a bit empty to make room for your creativity. Once launched, you'll be able to create your own Bounty for all to enjoy, and most importantly, allow you to customize your board to contain energizing moments that _**you**_ are looking forward to the most.

More Information:

* A custom Bounty can be made private
* X-Teamers can create **up to 5 Bounties per Season**
* **All X-Teamer Bounties will be worth 1 coin**, BUT we will be actively promoting good Bounties to be worth 2-3 coins, so if you want a coin to be high-value, make it a good one ;\)

### Missions

We're also introducing Missions, which are sets of Bounties with an exclusive reward once completed. The first Mission will challenge you to make your own Bounty, favorite someone else's, and then complete someone else's Bounty.

## House Perks

Also included in Early Access will be **House Perks,** which finally give Houses something other than glory to compete for.

There will be a variety of Perks released over time, but here are the Launch Day Perks:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Custom Vault Gear" %}
**Custom Vault Gear \(100 Luna\)**  
_Get a custom branded item for your House added to The Vault._

![](../.gitbook/assets/perk_vault_2x.gif)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Oculus 2 Sweepstakes" %}
**Oculus 2 Sweepstakes \(100 Luna\)**  
_Your House gets a sweepstakes for an Oculus 2 \(1 winner\). Your House decides how the winner is determined._

![](../.gitbook/assets/perk_vr_2x.gif)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="X-Team Radio Theme" %}
**X-Team Radio Theme \(100 Luna\)**  
_Your House decides the next X-Team Radio background theme._

![](../.gitbook/assets/perk_radio_2x%20%281%29.gif)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## **Introducing: Luna**

![](../.gitbook/assets/bloodcoin002_speed.gif)

Each House Perk costs **Luna**, a new currency just for Houses. Luna is earned a few ways:

* **Events:** Placing top scores in The Arena or VS, for example, will help your House earn Luna.
* **Gambling:** Houses can bet Luna against other Houses on the outcomes of Events.
* **Duels:** A House can challenge another House to a Duel in The Arena, 5v5. The Luna earned is based on a wager.

## Create a House

This Season also introduces the ability to form your own House together, letting you not only get your own House sigil, but also compete in Events together and earn Luna to spend on House Perks.

For more on this, check out "[Create a House](create-a-house.md)".

## The Vault

You can earn Coins or Stars by participating in [Events](../season-5-new-world./guide.md#events) or completing [Bounties](../season-5-new-world./guide.md#bounties). These let you purchase collectibles or donate to causes in [The Vault.](http://xhq.x-team.com/vault)

### **VS: PvP**

In Season 7, we're introducing **VS: PvP, the first VS where we'll host 1v1 matches between Houses.**

![Will you step forward and compete 1v1 for your House?](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2851%29.png)

The Houses will come together and decide on what competitions \(chess, Starcraft, running, etc.\) they are willing to compete on, and from there, matchmakers will arrange for 1v1 matches, with Luna going to the winning Houses.

This is a great way to cheer on and support your fellow House members as they compete for your House's success.

### **VS: Mario Kart Home Circuit**

We've teamed up with our friends at Surrogate.tv again for an exclusive and very special edition of VS, as we jump into real-life Mario Kart cars on a real, custom-built track. Thanks to the help of Mario Kart Home Circuit and some Surrogate.tv magic, this is a very rare opportunity indeed.

![Our friends at Surrogate.tv were able to make MK Home Circuit playable via browser.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2850%29.png)

Race winners will earn coins for themselves, and Luna for their House.

This is a 24-hour battle between the Houses of X-Team to see **who can rack up the most distance in Strava**. Every step counts, as Luna & Coins will be awarded to Houses with the **largest sum totals as well as to individuals with the largest totals.**
